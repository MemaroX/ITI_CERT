# ITI_CERT: Foundational C# Programming Tasks

`ITI_CERT` is a repository compiling foundational programming tasks and exercises completed as part of an Information Technology Institute (ITI) certification or training program. This project serves as a practical record of applied knowledge and skills gained in core C# programming concepts.

## Overview

This repository showcases a series of basic C# console applications designed to reinforce fundamental programming principles. Each task (`ITI_taskX.txt`) addresses a specific concept, ranging from basic input/output and arithmetic to understanding operator precedence and conditional logic. It reflects hands-on experience with C# syntax and problem-solving.

## Project Contents

-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
-   `ITI_task1.txt`: **Basic Input/Output & Addition.** A C# console application that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates and displays their sum.
-   `ITI_task2.txt`: **Arithmetic Operations & Operator Precedence.** A C# console application that takes six numerical inputs and performs various arithmetic calculations, demonstrating the use of different operators and their precedence.
-   `ITI_task3.txt`: **Increment/Decrement Operators.** A C# console application illustrating the behavior of the post-increment operator (`x++`) and its effect on variable values within expressions.
-   `ITI_task4.txt`: **Conditional Logic & Boolean Expressions.** A C# console application that takes three numerical inputs and evaluates several boolean conditions (e.g., checking if numbers are equal, different, or if one is the largest/smallest, and comparing sum vs. product).

## Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated

-   **C# Programming Language:** Core syntax, data types, and control flow.
-   **.NET Console Applications:** Basic application structure and execution.
-   **Input/Output Operations:** Reading user input (`Console.ReadLine()`) and displaying output (`Console.WriteLine()`).
-   **Data Type Conversion:** Converting string input to integer (`int.Parse()`) and float (`float.Parse()`).
-   **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
-   **Increment/Decrement Operators:** Understanding pre- and post-increment/decrement.
-   **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
-   **Logical Operators:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
-   **Conditional Logic:** Implementing `if-else` logic through boolean expressions.
-   **Problem Solving:** Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable programming tasks.

## Getting Started

This repository primarily serves as a documentation and portfolio piece. To understand the projects, review the `README.md` and examine the contents of the `ITI_taskX.txt` files.

### How to Run (for each task):

1.  Copy the content of an `ITI_taskX.txt` file into a new C# console application project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
2.  Build and run the project.
